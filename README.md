# Image Outpainting Project

Welcome to the Image Outpainting Project! This project demonstrates how to extend an image using the Stable Diffusion model, creating a natural and seamless extension.

## Project Overview

In this project, we take a 1024x1024 image and expand it by 128 pixels on each side. The goal is to ensure the new pixels blend naturally with the original image, maintaining the fantasy theme.

- Python 3.7 or higher
- The following libraries:

  - diffusers
  - transformers
  - torch
